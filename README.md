* Optional user authentication
* Optional third party authentication
* Rule system for automatic moderation

## Usage

Use docker to pull the latest development version of Uncomment:

```
docker pull nielssp/uncomment:master
```

Create a newenvioronment file with at least the following settings:

```
UNCOMMENT_HOST=https://your-website.com,https://uncomment.your-website.com
UNCOMMENT_SECRET_KEY=<secret key used (a long with a random salt) for hashing password>
UNCOMMENT_DEFAULT_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin
UNCOMMENT_DEFAULT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<password for first login>
```

You can generate a random secret key with `openssl rand -base64 20`.

Launch the Uncomment server:

```
docker run --rm --name uncomment -p 8080:8080 --env-file <your-env-file> -v <path-to-db-dir>:/db nielssp/uncomment:master
````

Add the following to your website:

```html
<div id="comments"></div>
<script data-uncomment
    data-uncomment-target="#comments"
    src="https://uncomment.your-website.com/en-GB/embed.js"></script>
```

## Server Configuration

Uncomment is configured via environment variables.

* `UNCOMMENT_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:5000` &ndash; hostname and port to listen to
* `UNCOMMENT_HOST` &ndash; comma-separated list of websites that will be accessing Uncomment
* `UNCOMMENT_SQLITE_DATABASE=data.db` &ndash; path to SQLite database file
* `UNCOMMENT_SECRET_KEY` &ndash; secret key used as part of Argon2 hash used for password hashing
* `UNCOMMENT_ARGON2_ITERATIONS=192` &ndash; number of Argon2 iterations to use, more iterations means more secure hash but slower login
* `UNCOMMENT_ARGON2_MEMORY_SIZE=4096`
* `UNCOMMENT_RATE_LIMIT=10` &ndash; maximum number of comments allowed from a single IP address within the time period specified by `UNCOMMENT_RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL`
* `UNCOMMENT_RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL=10` &ndash; minutes
* `UNCOMMENT_AUTO_THREADS=true` &ndash; automatically create threads. If disabled you must manually create threads in the dashboard.

* `UNCOMMENT_MODERATE_ALL=false` &ndash; whether all new comments should be marked as pending
* `UNCOMMENT_MAX_DEPTH=6` &ndash; maximum level of nesting allowed, cannot be higher than 6. 0 means that the comment list is completely flat and all replies are added to the end of the list.
