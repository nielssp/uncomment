## Server Configuration

Uncomment is configured via environment variables.

* `UNCOMMENT_SECRET_KEY` &ndash; secret key used as part of Argon2 hash used for password hashing
* `UNCOMMENT_ARGON2_ITERATIONS=192` &ndash; number of Argon2 iterations to use, more iterations means more secure hash but slower login
* `UNCOMMENT_ARGON2_MEMORY_SIZE=4096`
* `UNCOMMENT_RATE_LIMIT=10` &ndash; maximum number of comments allowed from a single IP address within the time period specified by `UNCOMMENT_RATE_LIMIT_INTERVAL`
